1. **Contract Initialization**:
   - The contract begins with specifying the version of the Solidity compiler and imports the necessary ERC-20 token interface. This interface is used to interact with the energy token that will be used for trading.

2. **State Variables**:
   - `owner`: This variable stores the address of the contract owner, which is set to the address that deploys the contract.
   - `energyToken`: It's an instance of an ERC-20 token that represents the energy token used for trading.
   - `trades`: This is an array of `Trade` structures that will store information about initiated trades.

3. **Struct**:
   - `Trade`: This is a custom data structure to represent a trade. It includes the buyer's address, the seller's address, the amount of energy being traded, the price at which the trade will occur, and a flag to indicate whether the trade has been settled.

4. **Events**:
   - `TradeInitiated`: This event is emitted when a trade is initiated, providing information about the buyer, seller, energy amount, and price.
   - `TradeSettled`: It's emitted when a trade is successfully settled.

5. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor is called when the contract is deployed. It sets the `owner` to the address that deploys the contract and initializes the `energyToken` with the address of the ERC-20 token to be used for trading.

6. **initiateTrade Function**:
   - Users can initiate a trade using this function. They specify the address of the seller, the amount of energy they want to buy/sell, and the price per unit of energy.
   - The function checks that the buyer and seller are not the same, and the energy amount is greater than 0.
   - It creates a new `Trade` object and adds it to the `trades` array, indicating that the trade is not settled yet.
   - The `TradeInitiated` event is emitted to log the initiation of the trade.

7. **settleTrade Function**:
   - This function is used to settle a trade, transferring energy and payment as specified in the trade.
   - It checks that the trade ID is valid and that the trade has not been settled before.
   - It calculates the total cost for the trade and transfers the energy from the buyer to the seller and the payment from the seller to the buyer.
   - Finally, it marks the trade as settled and emits the `TradeSettled` event.

This smart contract provides the basic infrastructure for P2P, P2G, and G2P energy trading. Users can initiate trades, and when both parties agree, the trade can be settled automatically. However, in a real-world application, you would need to integrate additional features, implement more complex logic to handle cross-border trading, and consider issues like token standards and decentralized data sources for real-time monitoring. Furthermore, extensive testing and security audits are crucial before deploying a contract for production use.
